/*
The Problem
Given a skyline (in a 1 dimensional array), your goal is to get to the furtehest building possible.
you start at zeroth building, with a finite number of bricks and ladder it doesent cost you anything 
to move to the building ahead of you 
if it is at the same level or lower.
However, if the building is higer, you must use either bricks or a ladder.
A ladder lets you scale any height differencec. However if you use bricks, to scale 
a height differencec of N, you must use N bricks

write a function to return the index of the furthest building you can get to, in the optimal case
e.g. [4,2,20,1,5] , 1 ladder , 4 bricks => return 4 (use ladder for 2->20, bricks for 1>5)

Console.WriteLine("result:" + FarthestBuildingAllVariation(egArray, ladder, bricks,0));
//output for this array { 4, 12, 2, 7, 3,18,20,3,19 } is result:7
//output for this array { 4, 12, 2, 7, 3,18,20,3,6 } is result:8
